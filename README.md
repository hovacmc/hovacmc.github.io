## What does this do?

We provide LUA scripts along with paid and free Roblox exploits.
Exploits are cheats which allow you to execute your own code in
Roblox games. All of our free exploits come with VirusTotal links
and the paid ones have their prices listed so you know everything is
safe.

## Why is this needed?

Most websites supplying Roblox exploits give out viruses.
Luckily, our VirusTotal links exists.

If any free exploit's VirusTotal says its a keylogger or RAT, 
dont get it.

If it says Trojan, unknown or anything like that it should
be fine. (this just means the antivirus thinks its one)

## Is this safe?

Yes, our website is open sourced here on Github and you can
see for yourself!
